THE BUS RESERVATION SYSTEM -BUILT USING JAVA AND MYSQL:
*	The Java Bus Reservation System is a comprehensive software application developed using Core Java and Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS) principles.  
*	It facilitates the booking, cancelation, and management of bus reservations, including sending confirmation emails, retrieving ticket information, and monitoring available seats.
* The project also incorporates CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, allowing for seamless manipulation of reservation data stored securely in the MySQL database using the JDBC connector
NOTES:
* In DBconnection class we need to give the database server address and password to connect with MySQL database to get the connection object.
* In Sendingemail class we have to use that email which is used as a sender email by us and also we need app password for that particular email to run the code.
